Repository containing MATLAB and python programs for analyzing x-ray
fluorescence data collected at Sectors 2 and 26 of the Advanced 
Photon Source of Argonne National Lab (Lemont, USA).

Note this repository encourages the use of python; those programs
have been maintained and kept up to date. The MATLAB programs have not
been modified for some time, and are here for reference.
